Land piles in Hong Kong are simple and not much that we can work on.

I will propose that we do offshore piles (normally tubular piles driven using hydraulic hammer). The calculation of the capacity is generally straightford and using an $\alpha$ and $\beta$ method. 

Let's assume the geological condition is really simple, but typical in Hong Kong offshore, i.e., two layers comprising Marine Deposit Overlaying Alluvium
